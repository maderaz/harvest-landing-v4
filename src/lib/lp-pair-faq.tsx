// FAQ items reserved for LP-pair Autocompounders. Q2, Q4, Q7
// differ substantially from the single-asset Autocompounder FAQ:
// Q2 explains the LP-add flow (rewards split into both pair
// assets), Q4 explains the dual-source nature of LP yield
// (fees + emissions), Q7 introduces impermanent loss in plain
// language. Halborn audit reference is preserved; no mention of
// an Autopilot engine because none exists here.

Those rewards are then converted in the proportions needed to add liquidity back into the same pool, increasing the size of the LP position held by the vault and the value of each holder's share. The process repeats automatically; holders are not required to claim, swap, or add liquidity themselves. Autocompounding events run when economically feasible, anywhere from hourly to several days apart, with gas costs socialised across all holders.`;

First, trading fees on the ${ticker}/${counterpart} pool on ${platform}: every swap between the two assets pays a fee, a share of which accrues to liquidity providers. Second, ${reward} emissions distributed by ${platform} to incentivise liquidity in the pool, which the strategy claims and adds back into the position.

Because the position holds both ${ticker} and ${counterpart}, the value of the position also moves with the relative price of the two assets in the pair: when the two prices diverge, the LP position is worth less than holding the two tokens separately would have been. This is commonly referred to as impermanent loss. ${reward} rewards partially offset this, but the offset is not guaranteed and depends on emission rates and the magnitude of price divergence. Harvest's core vault infrastructure was audited by Halborn in January 2025. Audits reduce but do not eliminate risk.`;
