// This used to read apyBreakdown[0].source and call it the payout token. That
// was wrong, and the way it was wrong matters enough to record.
//
// apyBreakdown and rewardTokens are built from two different upstream arrays
// in harvest-api.ts: the breakdown maps over estimatedApyBreakdown (the
// values), rewardTokens maps over apyTokenSymbols (the symbols). The source
// string is therefore apyTokenSymbols[0], which is the first ICON shown beside
// the APY in the app, not a settlement currency. Three things follow:
//
//   1. When upstream sends more symbols than values, the extra symbols survive
//      only in rewardTokens. Six Morpho vaults on Arbitrum report source "ARB"
//      while their rewardTokens list ARB and MORPHO, so one number labelled ARB
//      covers at least two emissions plus the underlying interest.
//   2. Five identical Aave v3 USDC supply positions carry two different labels:
//      the Ethereum pair reports "USDC", the Base, Polygon and Arbitrum three
//      report "AAVE", and all five sit in the same 2.3% to 3.4% band. Our own
//      feed disagrees with itself about the same strategy.
//   3. The "Base Rate" fallback fires on zero rows. Every source in the file is
//      a ticker, so "USDC" is the same kind of label as "MORPHO".
//
// So the page cannot claim a rate is paid in a token, and it equally cannot
// claim a split between base interest and emissions, because apyBreakdown
// carries one entry per vault whose apy equals apy24h. What it can report is
// the token list: which tokens a strategy harvests. Reading the whole
// rewardTokens array rather than one label also picks up the second tokens
// point 1 was dropping.
//
// Curated override of an upstream label, named here rather than buried: Aave
// no longer issues AAVE emissions on its USDC markets. The three rows still
// carrying the label hold about $570 between them, and two identical positions
// on Ethereum are labelled USDC, so the label is stale metadata rather than a
