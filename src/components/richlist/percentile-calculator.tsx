// The percentile calculator on /xrp-rich-list.
//
// Three rules from the build spec drive every decision here.
//
// It never asks for a wallet address. A form requesting an address on a page
// about the largest holders looks exactly like phishing, in a community that
// is unusually alert to it, and the notice under the field says so explicitly
// rather than leaving the user to infer it.
//
// It computes client-side against a build-time ladder. No request per lookup,
// so no balance a visitor types is ever transmitted or logged.
//
// Its output is positive at every balance. The page title promises a rank, so
// the result is framed as a position rather than as a verdict: "you are in the
// top 23%, larger than 6.2 million accounts", never "you are not in the top
// 10%". Most XRPL accounts hold very little, so most people place higher than
// they expect, and that surprise is what gets shared.
