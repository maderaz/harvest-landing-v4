// Two questions arrive on this page and only one of them had a tool. "Where
// does my balance rank" is what the page is for and what it ranks for; "what
// would that balance earn" is the question a rank raises, and answering it
// meant sending the reader to another page. The switch keeps both here.
//
// THE RICH LIST CALCULATOR IS THE DEFAULT AND STAYS THE DEFAULT. It holds the
// best click-through on the page, the H2 above it is what "xrp rich list
// calculator" matches, and the staking tool is the second answer rather than
// a replacement. The switch renders after it in the DOM for the same reason:
// what a crawler reads first should be what the page is about.
//
// Only one calculator is mounted at a time. Rendering both and hiding one
// would put a second set of form controls and a second product list into the
// page for every visitor who never touches the switch, and would give the
// document two elements with the same ids.
