// The XRP staking calculator on /report/xrp-yield-ranking.
//
// The page is titled "XRP Staking: 10+ Ways to Earn & Calculator", so the tool
// has to exist before the title ships: a title that promises something the
// page does not have sends the visitor back to the results, and that signal
// costs more than the extra click was worth.
//
// Three rules carried over from the rich-list calculator, for the same
// reasons.
//
// It never asks for a wallet address. A form requesting an address on a page
// about XRP yield reads as phishing to this community, and there is nothing an
// address would add: the arithmetic needs an amount and a rate.
//
// It computes in the browser against build-time constants. No request per
// lookup, so no amount a visitor types is transmitted or logged.
//
// It says the rate moves in the same breath as it projects it. A calculator
// that annualises one day's rate without that line is making a forecast, which
// this site does not do. The line under the result is not conditional on the
// number being large or small.
//
// The result panel carries the snapshot date exactly once, in the sentence
// that attributes the rate. An earlier version printed it in the headline, the
// detail line and both bullets, which reads as templated filler rather than as
// four separate attributions.
