// Landscape TVL aggregator for /report/xrp-yield-ranking.
//
// WHY: the report tracks the whole XRP-denominated DeFi yield landscape, and we
// want one honest "total TVL over time" series showing how that landscape grew.
// No single feed carries it, so we stitch the best XRP-SPECIFIC series per venue:
//   - Per-pool daily TVL from DeFiLlama /chart (already in data/xrp-yield.json's
//     `history[].tvl`, backfilled to inception) for the pool-indexed venues
//     (Aerodrome, Moonwell, Kinetic, SparkDEX, Mystic).
//   - Protocol-level Flare TVL from DeFiLlama for Upshift, whose entire Flare
//     presence IS its XRP vaults (earnXRP + mXRPY) — the /yields endpoint does
//     not break the pool out, but /protocol/upshift chainTvls.Flare does, back
//     to inception. This is the single biggest venue (~$45M), so without it the
//     aggregate badly understates the landscape.
//   - Protocol-level Flare + Base TVL for Spectra, whose XRP-family PT/LP markets
//     on those chains are its presence there (using protocol level also avoids
//     double-counting the same market's PT and LP, which the per-product rows
//     would otherwise sum twice).
// Venues without any daily series (e.g. Superform's tiny $0.3M) are folded in at
// their current snapshot from their first indexed day — immaterial to the shape.
//
// Methodology is mixed (per-pool + protocol-level) but non-overlapping: the
// protocol-level venues (Upshift, Spectra) are disjoint from the pool-indexed
// ones, so nothing is counted twice. The series is written to
// data/xrp-yield.json as `landscape` for the page to render with no network at
// build/render time. Runs after fetch-xrp-yield + apply-xrp-overrides.
//
// Requires network (DeFiLlama, unauthenticated). In the sandbox, run with
// NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 so Node's fetch honours the agent proxy.
