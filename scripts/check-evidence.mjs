// That distinction is worth nothing if a value can arrive without a source, so
// it is enforced here rather than remembered.
//
// A value may be either sourced, with a URL and the date the page was read, or
// explicitly marked "unconfirmed" when it was carried over from a supplied
// list and has never been checked at the venue. What it may not be is silent.
